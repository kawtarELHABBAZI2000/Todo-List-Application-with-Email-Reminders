Assignment: Todo List Application with Email Reminders

Objective
Develop a full-stack application with the following components:

Django Backend: A RESTful API for a todo list.
FastAPI Microservice: An email reminder service using Postmark SMTP.
Vue.js Frontend: A user interface for the todo list.
Docker and Docker Compose: Containerization of all components and orchestration.

Requirements:

Django REST Backend:
- Create a Django project with REST framework.
- Implement a Todo model with fields like title, description, due_date, and status.
- Develop CRUD API endpoints for the Todo model.

FastAPI Email Reminder Service:
- Set up a FastAPI project.
- Implement an email sending feature using Postmark SMTP with the provided credentials.
- Trigger emails for due tasks (you can simulate this based on a manual trigger for simplicity).

Vue.js Frontend:
- Develop a basic Vue.js app to display and manage the todo list.
- Include functionalities to add, view, edit, and delete tasks, interfacing with the Django backend.

Docker and Docker Compose:
- Containerize each component (Django, FastAPI, Vue.js)
- Create a Docker Compose file to run these services together.
- Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests to the appropriate services.

Documentation:
- Provide a README file with setup and run instructions.

Deliverables
- Source code for Django, FastAPI, and Vue.js.
- Dockerfiles and a Docker Compose file.
- README with instructions.

How to deliver:
- Clone the following project: https://github.com/tasbiqmorocco/assignment
- Each one of you should decide on what they want to work on, and create a branch for it.
- When your work is done on the branch, create a PR to merge it with the main branch.

Timeframe
- The assignment should be completed in 3 days.

Sending emails with SMTP
- Server: smtp.postmarkapp.com
- Ports: 25, 2525, or 587
- Authentication: Plain text, CRAM-MD5, or TLS

Authenticate with a Server Token and specify Stream with a Header:
- Username: 3ca9152a-303d-47b4-96dd-4e20acc2e973
- Password: 3ca9152a-303d-47b4-96dd-4e20acc2e973
- Header: X-PM-Message-Stream: outbound

Additional Notes
- Keep the scope of each component basic and focused on core functionalities.
- Prioritize functionality and integration over advanced features.
- Ensure clear and concise documentation for setup and operation.
- Even if each one of you will be working on a part of the project, each one of you will be asked about the whole project, and you should be able to reproduce everything by yourself.
- You can always ask questions about your assignment during the daily meetings.
- Make sure your code is well commented so that anyone can understand what you're doing.
- Feel free to organize online meetings with each other to work on the project.

This assignment is structured to provide a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack development, microservices, and containerization, within a manageable scope for a 3-day period.

Good luck!
